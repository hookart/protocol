/// @title A covered call instrument
/// @author Jake Nyquist -- j@hook.xyz
/// @notice This contract implements a "Covered Call Option". A call option gives the holder the right, but not
/// the obligation to purchase an asset at a fixed time in the future (the expiry) for a fixed price (the strike).
/// The call option implementation here is similar to a "european" call option because the asset can
/// only be purchased at the expiration. The call option is "covered"  because the underlying
/// asset, (in this case a NFT), must be held in escrow for the entire duration of the option. In the context
/// of a single call option from this implementation contract, the role of the writer is non-transferrable.
///
/// There are three phases to the call option:
///
/// (1) WRITING:
/// The owner of the NFT can mint an option by calling the "mint" function using the parameters of the subject ERC-721;
/// specifying additionally their preferred strike price and expiration. An "insturment nft" is minted to the writer's
/// address, where the holder of this ERC-721 will recieve the economic benefit of holding the option.
///
/// (2) SALE:
/// The sale occurs outside of the context of this contract; however, the ZeroEx market contracts are pre-approved to
/// transfer the tokens. By Selling the instrument NFT, the writer earns a "premium" for selling their option. The
/// option may be sold and re-sold multiple times.
///
/// (3) SETTLEMENT:
/// One day prior to the expiration, and auction begins. People are able to call bid() for more than the strike price to
/// place a bid. If, at settlement, the high bid is greater than the strike, (bid - strike) is transferred to the holder
/// of the insturment NFT, the strike price is transferred to the writer. The high bid is transferred to the holder of
/// the option.
///
/// @dev The HookCoveredCall is a BeaconProxy, which allows the implemenation of the protocol to be upgraded in the
/// future. Further, each covered call is mapped to a specific ERC-721 contract address -- meaning there is one covered
/// call contract per collection.
